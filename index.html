              <p>
                When Joey first approached us about working together, I'll be
                honest—I was skeptical. We're a staff of 18 with limited
                bandwidth, and I've had experiences with consultants who promise
                the world but don't understand our reality.
              </p>
              <p>
                Joey was different from day one. He actually slowed down to
                match our pace. For three months, he was like this patient
                strategist in our corner—researching our work, sending
                thoughtful insights, and building real relationships with our
                team. He seamlessly integrated himself into our workflow, so
                that instead of feeling like a "consultant," he felt like a real
                member of the team.
              </p>
              <p>
                The breakthrough came when Joey interviewed our program alumni.
                Watching him create that space for authentic storytelling—and
                seeing how it reconnected me with why I do this work—that's when
                I knew we had something special. No one had ever really captured
                the impact of our program in a way that is both personal and
                profound. It’s hard sometimes to step back and tell the story of
                our organization in a fresh way, and Joey did exactly that.
              </p>
              <p>
                The work that Joey has done for our organization will last long
                beyond this single fundraising campaign. The alumni videos are
                evergreen assets which we can use with grantors, donors,
                principals, parents, and more. And the strategy that Joey lined
                up for us will serve as a blueprint for all our further
                campaigns. Thanks to him, we’re reaching people we’ve never
                connected with before, on platforms where we were stagnant for
                years. Of the dozen or so consultants we’ve worked with, Joey is
                by far the absolute best.

                people who represent your mission. One thoughtful conversation
                can create up to a 100 meaningful touchpoints that gradually
                bring new supporters into your community.

              <h3>Support Fundraising</h3>
              <p>
                We built a fundraising campaign around a video series that drove
                supporters to Givebutter while simultaneously celebrating the
                life-changing outcomes their funding makes possible. The
                story-driven approach brought people further into the community
                by showing real impact rather than just asking for money.

              <h3>Grow on Social</h3>
              <p>
                LinkedIn became our secret weapon for advocates beyond northern
                Manhattan who have a natural affinity for supporting young
                writers and their development. We created a campaign centered on
                'the kid we once were'— protecting young people's time and space
                to write, find themselves, and grow into their authentic voices.
                The message about voice as empowerment, especially in today's
                cultural moment.
